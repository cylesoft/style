# Cylesoft Style Guides

Frameworks for both the Cylesoft "Simple" look and the Cylesoft "Gridded" look. Both are fully responsive from desktop to mobile.

The **Simple** look has one center column 550 pixels wide, meant for long form text, with the capacity for special "aside" paragraphs.

The **Gridded** look is a basic twelve-column grid system, meant for whatever.
